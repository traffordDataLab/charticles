                <h1>High levels of claimant rate for young adults</h1>
                <time datetime="2021-04-15">APRIL 15, 2021</time>

                <p>
                    The levels of claimant rate as a proportion of Trafford's population within each age band significantly increased after the start of the Covid-19 pandemic from March 2020, particularly for the age bands 16-24 and 25-34 which were already having higher claimant rates pre-pandemic compared to the other age bands. Both age bands had reached a rate of 7% or above in February 2021, an increase of more than 4% rate relative to February 2021.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The sudden rise in claimant rate ended in May 2020, after which the rate fluctuated more gradually until February 2021 when it clearly increased again for all age bands, coinciding with the national lockdown starting in January 2020.
