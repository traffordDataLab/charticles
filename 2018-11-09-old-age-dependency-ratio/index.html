            <p>
                The old-age dependency ratio (OADR) is the number of people of State Pension age (65 years or older) as a percentage of the working age population (16-64 years). Bowdon and Hale Barns recorded the highest old-age dependency ratio in 2017 with the number of pensioners equivalent to 44.7% of its labour force. This is similar to the old-age dependency ratio of Japan* which has the world's highest OADR. At 13.2% Clifford ward had the lowest share of pensioners as a proportion of the working age population.
