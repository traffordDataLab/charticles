                <p>
                    Google's <a href="https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/index.html?hl=en" target="_blank">community mobility data</a> allows us to monitor change in the percentage of trips made to various locations in Trafford during the course of the coronavirus outbreak compared to a baseline*.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Visits to retail and recreational locations such as restaurants, cafes, shopping centres, theme parks, museums, libraries, and cinemas fell sharply after the introduction of lockdown restrictions in late March 2020. The frequency of visits has increased very slowly reaching 11% above the baseline on 31 August, the Summer Bank Holiday. Levels have since plateaued at around -25% below the baseline.</li>
                    <li>Trips to supermarkets and pharmacies also fell after lockdown but not as sharply as visits to retail and recreational locations. Levels have remained stable at around -17% below the baseline since early summer.</li>
                    <li>Visits to local parks are quite variable because of changing weather conditions. However, after a fall post-lockdown levels exceeded the baseline during the summer but have since fallen.</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="notes">
                    *The baseline is the median value for the same day of the week, 3 January - 6 February 2020.
