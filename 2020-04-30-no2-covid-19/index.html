              The UK introduced a nationwide lockdown on 23rd of March 2020 to reduce the onward transmission of coronavirus (<a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus" target="_blank">COVID-19</a>). Low levels of air pollution have been reported following the lockdown and attributed to reduced road traffic and industrial activity <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-52202974" target="_blank">across the UK</a>. During the lockdown, weekly mean levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) recorded by the air quality monitoring station on the A56 in Trafford has remained lower than the weekly mean levels for the same period during 2019 and 2018. Interestingly, NO<sub>2</sub> levels <em>before</em> the lockdown were also noticeably lower than during the preceding years. It is difficult to know why this is the case but weather conditions are likely to have played a significant part because <a href="https://www.apple.com/covid19/mobility" target="_blank">local</a> and <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/876889/FINAL_Press_Conference_Slides_20200330.pdf" target="_blank">national</a> road traffic levels seem to have been normal.
