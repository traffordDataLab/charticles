                <h1>Employees working in Trafford earn less than those that live in Trafford</h1>
                <time datetime="2025-09-16">SEPTEMBER 16, 2025</time>
                
                <p>
                  The Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE) 2024 estimates that employees working in Trafford have a median Annual pay of £29,848.00, almost 20% (£5,766.00) less than the median Annual pay of employees living in Trafford at £35,614.00.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The median hourly pay of employees working in Trafford is £15.60, which is 25.6% (£4.00) less than the median hourly pay of employees that live in Trafford at £19.60.
                </p>
                
                <p>To aid comparison regardless of hours worked, the graph below shows median hourly pays for employees split by full-part time, female-male, and their combinations. For all groups, employees working in Trafford earn less per hour than those living in Trafford.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                 Focusing on employees working in Trafford, the median hourly pay difference between Female and Male (gender gap) is £2.70 and for Part Time and Full Time workers is £4.73.
                 </p>
                 
                 <p>Coming from a survey, the figures are estimates that have associated confidence intervals shown on the graph as lines crossing the points. For example, the larger lines of the Male Part Time split are due to the reduced number of samples and represent the range where the true value is likely to be.
