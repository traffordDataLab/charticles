                <h1>Housing is becoming less affordable in Trafford</h1>
                <time datetime="2022-08-25">August 25, 2022</time>

                <p>In 2010 the median house price in Trafford was £180,000 increasing to £325,000 in 2021 which represents an 80.6% rise.  In contrast the median gross annual workplace-based earnings in Trafford has increased just 21% during the same period from £26,092 in 2010 to £31,567 in 2021.</p>
                
                <p>Housing affordability can be measured by the affordability ratio which indicates how many multiples of the median annual earnings are needed to buy a house of the median price for an area. Housing has become less affordable over the years with the affordability ratio increasing 49.3% from 2010 to 2021.  A more notable decrease in housing affordability occurred when the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic brought a steep rise in the median house price which also caused a steep rise in the affordability ratio from 9.5 in 2020 to 10.3 in 2021 in Trafford. This is part of a national trend where England’s affordability ratio increased from 7.9 in 2020 to 9.1 in 2021.</p>
